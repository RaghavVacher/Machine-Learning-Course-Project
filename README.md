# Machine-Learning-Course-Project
Machine Learning Course Project

### Goal of the Project

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

### Data

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

Cross Validation
As the data-sets have already been divided into training and testing data-sets, I would no be further dividing the datasets and use the already cross validated datasets

Creation of the Algorithm
The algorithm will be a random forest based training. This is done as random forests provides a good and easy ML algorithm which has a high accuracy.

```library(caret)
  #Creation of Models
  model_rf <- train(classe ~ ., method = "rf", data = training)
    model_rf
## Random Forest 
## 
## 19622 samples
##    52 predictor
##     5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' 
## 
## No pre-processing
## Resampling: Bootstrapped (25 reps) 
## Summary of sample sizes: 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, 19622, ... 
## Resampling results across tuning parameters:
## 
##   mtry  Accuracy   Kappa    
##    2    0.9929344  0.9910648
##   27    0.9926181  0.9906651
##   52    0.9853780  0.9815088
## 
## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
## The final value used for the model was mtry = 2.
  predict_rf <- predict(model_rf, testing)
  predict_rf
##  [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B
## Levels: A B C D E
```
As seen above the in-sample accuracy is 99, which is a considerably high accuracy. Applying this to the test set using the quiz, the results are as follows: 20/20 in the quiz results. Therefore the out-sample error and RSME is negligible.
